1. Auscultation
1. Closing
1. Mark scheme
1. Questions
1. Technique

## Introduction
**Wash hands**
**Introduction** - name, position
**Check patient details** - name, date of birth, age
**Explanation** - I would like to perform an examination of your chest which will involve...
**Consent** - is that okay?
**Positioning** - 45 degrees
**Exposure** - whole chest to hips
**Question** - any pain?

## General

### Around bed
- Oxygen
- Inhalers/nebulisers
- Sputum pot - note colour of sputum

### Patient
- Speaking in full sentences?
- Breathless: tripod position, using accessory muscles, intercostal recession, pursed lips, nasal flaring
- Cyanosed or pale
- Cough, wheeze, stridor
- Cachexic

## Extremities

### Nails

**Inspection**
- Clubbing - lung cancer, ILD, bronchiectasis
- Peripheral cyanosis - O2 saturations <85%
- Tar staining - smoker: increased risk of COPD and lung cancer.

### Hands

**Inspection**
- Wasting - lung cancer
- Pallor - anaemia
- Thinning, bruised skin: steroids - COPD, asthma, ILD
- Rheumatoid arthritis - pleural effusion, pulmonary fibrosis
- Fine tremor - bronchodilator use
- Coarse tremor: CO2 retention flap - COPD

**Palpation**
- Temperature
- Capillary refill time

### Wrist

**Inspection**
- Respiratory rate

**Palpation**
- Pulse: rate, rhythm
- Painful swelling of wrists - may indicate squamous cell Ca of lung

### Arm

- BP

## Face

### Eyes
- Conjunctival pallor: ask patient to pull down lower eyelid - anaemia
- Swollen eyes - SVC obstruction
- Hornerâ€™s sign: ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis - pancoast tumour

### Face
- Malar Flush
- Cushingoid

### Mouth
- Cyanosis - central (under tongue)
- Candida - steroids

### Neck

**Inspection**
- JVP - cor pulmonale
  - 45 degrees
  - Turn head to left
  - Look at sternocleidomastoid
  - Measure number of cm above sternal notch

**Palpation**
- Tracheal tug - three fingers on trachea
- Tracheal deviation - to right or left
- Cricosternal distance - normally 3-4 fingers
- Lymph nodes

## Chest

### Front of chest

**Inspection** - ask patient to lift arms, look at sides as well
- Scars
  - Mid axilla, small - chest drain
  - Horizontal posterolateral - thoracotomy (pneumonectomy, lobectomy)
- Chest wall deformity - barrel chest (COPD), excavatum, carinatum, kyphoscholiosis
- Asymmetry - surgery (pneumonectomy - cancer, thoracoplasty - tuberculosis)

**Palpation**
- Chest wall expansion - only need to do once
- Apex beat - midclavicular line, 5th intercostal space

**Percussion**
- Clavicles: percuss directly without placing finger on top of clavicle
- Two other areas - resonant (normal), hyper-resonant (air), dull (fluid)
- Axillae

**Auscultation and vocal resonance**
- Apex
- Two other areas
- Axillae

### Back

- Inspection for scars again - pneumonectomy, lobectomy
- Expansion
- Percussion
  - Three areas
- Auscultation and vocal resonance
  - Three areas
- **Sacral oedema**

## Legs
- Rash - erythema nodosum
- Pedal oedema

## Finish

Thank patient and ask if they have any questions

## Extra tests
- **Examination** - Cardiovascular (if indicated)
- **Bedside** - O2 saturations, PEFR
- **Bloods** - ABG (if low saturations)
- **Imaging** - CXR
- **Microbiology** - sputum culture

## Technique

### Chest wall expansion

Ask patient to take a deep breath in and out, place hands on chest wrapping hands around the base of chest and oppose your thumbs, then ask patient to breath in again to see how the tips of your thumbs move to assess expansion and symmetry.

### Vocal resonance

Ask the patient to repeat 99 each time you place your stethoscope down.

### Auscultation

**Added sounds**
- Crepitations: crackles, can be fine or coarse
- Wheeze: expiratory noise (mainly)
- Stridor: inspiratory noise
- Pleuritic Rub: sounds like walking on snow
- Bronchial Breathing ("tubular", louder expiration)
