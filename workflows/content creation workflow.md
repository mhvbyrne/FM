# Content creation workflow

This describes the Worklow used for the generation of new revision material, referred to as the "Contribution". Our model involves publication after review by the Editor, with an update following review by Reviewers and Senior Reviewers.

1. *Author* recruitment advertised
1. Author recruited
1. *Editor* sends Contributor Package to the *Author*
1. *Author* to read Contributor Package, including: Welcome letter; Content brief; Contractual agreement; Github tutorial; Markdown tutorial
1. Deadline agreed

## Review

1. *Reviewers* and *Senior Reviewers* to read Contributor Package including: Welcome letter; Content brief; Contractual agreement; Github tutorial; Markdown tutorial
1. *Author* sends github link to *Reviewers* and *Senior Reviewers*
1. *Reviewers* and *Senior Reviewers* create a contributor profile folder on github, including: Contributor profile description; Profile picture; Signed contractual agreement
1. *Reviewers* and *Senior Reviewers* review the contribution and suggest or make changes
1. *Editor* reviews suggestions and changes
1. *Author* makes remaining changes
1. *Editor* approves final draft
1. Published contribution is updated online
1. Contribution is moved to hardcopy

Failure to meet deadline without prior notorisation will result in a warning, if there is further failure to meet deadlines the Editors may choose to ban the user from content creation.

## Later editions

To ensure that our content remains up to date we regularly review it's accuracy.

1. The previous author is contacted and asked if they wish to update their contribution with a given deadline to reply
1. If the previous author does not reply before this deadline a new author is recruited
1. The content creation workflow is restarted

## Multiple authorship

The same workflow is followed when there are multiple authors for a single contribution. All authors hold equal responsibility for any issues arising.
