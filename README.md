This is the contributor guide for creating content for **Focus**|Medicine.

## Markdown

Writing in Markdown is just like writing in a word processor e.g. Microsoft Word but with the formatting buttons removed.

Instead you write the formatting as simple code. Click "Raw" on the top right to see how this page was written.

Please read this [guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code) for how to write in Markdown.

### What are the benefits of writing in Markdown?

1. While it may seem conter-intuitive at first it is actually a lot quicker to write this way once you have got the hang of it. This is because you do not need to click to make things bold or to change headings etc.
1. Because it is so simple, it is very easy to pick up.
1. Separating formatting from the core text means that broad changes to formatting can be made so that everything follows the same style.
1. Sections of text which are repeated can be linked rather than copied. This means that if you want to change the text that is repeated across multiple documents you only need to edit it once, rather than going into each document to make the same change multiple times.
1. As well as linking sections of text, things like authorships can be linked, so that you get the credit that you are due on your profile page.
1. Different sections of the website can be automated and searched, which means less work for everyone!

## What are the benefits of using Github?

1. While it may seem a bit intimidating initially, once you've got the hang of it GitHub is a great collaboration tool. Even better than Google Drive!
1. Unlike Google Drive GitHub accurately tracks the input of all authors, and all authors can access the material and make changes which are then approved by the person who owns the repository.
1. This means that we can see who make changes, and we can prevent errors (such as deleting all the content) from occuring.

## Adding multiple contributors to content

To add multiple Authors, Reviewers, or Senior Reviewers to content you need to include each author's name in quote marks seprated by bullet points. Your Markdown code will look like this:

```
Authors:
- "Matthew Byrne"
- "Thomas Western"
```
