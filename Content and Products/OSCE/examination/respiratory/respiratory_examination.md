# Respiratory Examination

## Objectives

The respiratory examination is very common station during clinical examinations. Here we demonstrate our concise Respiratory Examination that will help you pick up on key clinical signs during your exam.

## Introduction

**Wash hands**

**Introduction** - Name, position

**Check patient details** - Name, date of birth, age

**Explanation** - "I would like to perform an examination of your chest which will involve looking at your hands, face, and chest, placing my hands on your chest, and listening with a stethoscope."

**Consent** - Is that okay?

**Positioning** - 45 degrees

**Exposure** - Whole chest to hips - "So that I can properly see your chest can you remove your top please?" In exams, it is not necessary to ask females to remove their bra.

**Question** - "Before we start do you have any pain or questions?"

## General Inspection

### Around bed
- Oxygen
- Inhalers/nebulisers
- Sputum pot - note colour of sputum
  - Green - infective causes
  - Blood stained - infective causes, cancer, pulmonary embolism
  - Frothy - heart failure

### Patient
- Age
  - Young - asthma, cystic fibrosis
  - Old - pneumonia, cancer, COPD, interstitial lung disease
- Speaking in full sentences? - severely short of breath
- Breathless - tripod position, using accessory muscles, intercostal recession, pursed lips, nasal flaring
- Cyanosed - oxygen saturation <85%
- Pallor - anaemia of chronic disease
- Added sounds - cough, wheeze, stridor
- Cachexic - chronic disease - cancer, COPD, cystic fibrosis

## Extremities

### Nails
- Clubbing - lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis
- Peripheral cyanosis - oxygen saturations <85%
- Tar staining - smoker - increased risk of COPD and lung cancer.

### Hands

#### Inspection
- Wasting - lung cancer
- Pallor - anaemia
- Thinning, bruised skin - steroids - used in exacerbations of COPD and asthma, and interstitial lung disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis - pleural effusion, pulmonary fibrosis
- Fine tremor - bronchodilator use
- Coarse tremor - carbon dioxide retention flap - COPD

#### Palpation
- Temperature
- Capillary refill time

### Wrist

#### Inspection
- Respiratory rate
  - Complete while taking pulse, do not mention to the patient that you are checking their respiratory rate otherwise they will become concious of their breathing and you will not obtain an accurate rate.
  - Look at the patient's sternum and count breaths taken over a 15 second period.
  - Multiply by four to obtain the total number over one minute. Make sure to remember this for your summary!

#### Palpation
- Pulse - rate, rhythm - over 15 second period and multiply by four. Make sure to remember this for your summary!
- Painful swelling of wrists - may indicate squamous cell carcinoma of lung

### Arm
- Blood pressure

## Face

### Eyes
- Conjunctival pallor - ask patient to pull down lower eyelid - anaemia
- Swollen eyes - superior vena cava obstruction
- Horner’s sign - ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis - pancoast tumour

### Face
- Malar Flush
- Cushingoid

### Mouth
- Cyanosis - central (under tongue)
- Candida - steroids

### Neck

#### Inspection
- JVP - cor pulmonale
  - 45 degrees
  - Turn head to left
  - Look at sternocleidomastoid
  - Measure number of centimeters above sternal notch

#### Palpation
- Tracheal tug - three fingers on trachea
- Tracheal deviation - to right or left
- Cricosternal distance - normally 3-4 fingers
- Lymph nodes

## Chest

### Front of chest

#### Inspection

Ask patient to lift arms, to look at sides as well

- Scars
  - Mid axilla, small - chest drain
  - Horizontal posterolateral - thoracotomy for pneumonectomy, lobectomy
- Chest wall deformity - barrel chest in COPD, excavatum, carinatum, kyphoscholiosis
- Asymmetry - surgery e.g. pneumonectomy - cancer, thoracoplasty - tuberculosis

#### Palpation
- Chest wall expansion - only need to do once
- Apex beat - midclavicular line, 5th intercostal space

#### Percussion
- Clavicles - percuss directly without placing finger on top of clavicle
- Two other areas
- Axillae

Note quality of sound
- Resonant - normal
- Hyper-resonant - air
- Dull - fluid

#### Auscultation and vocal resonance
- Apex
- Two other areas
- Axillae

### Back

- Inspection for scars again - pneumonectomy, lobectomy
- Expansion
- Percussion
  - Three areas
- Auscultation and vocal resonance
  - Three areas
- **Sacral oedema**

## Legs
- Rash - erythema nodosum
- Pedal oedema

## Finish

Thank patient and ask if they have any questions

## Extra tests

To finish I would also like to perform the following:
- **Examination** - Cardiovascular (if indicated)
- **Bedside** - Oxygen saturations, blood pressure, peak expiratory flow rate.
- **Bloods** - Arterial blood gas (if low saturations)
- **Imaging** - Chest X ray
- **Microbiology** - Sputum culture

## Summary

If you are completing your examination as part of a separate examination station in your exam you can use the following summary structure. If you are completing it alongside a history you should start with your history summary before moving on to your examination summary and omit the demographic information at the start.

This is a 'age' 'sex', on inspection there was... on palpation there was... on percussion there was... on auscultation there was...

## Differential

**Most likely diagnosis** – "My top differential is…"

**Differential** – "My other differentials are…"

**Less likely important conditions not to miss** – "I would also like to rule out..."

## Technique

### Chest wall expansion

Ask patient to take a deep breath in and out, place hands on chest wrapping hands around the base of chest and oppose your thumbs, then ask patient to breath in again to see how the tips of your thumbs move to assess expansion and symmetry.

### Vocal resonance

Ask the patient to repeat 99 each time you place your stethoscope down. Some universities do not require you to complete vocal resonance, you should check with the education team if it is expected for you to ask.

### Added sounds on auscultation
- **Crepitations** - sounds like crackles, and can be fine or coarse
- **Wheeze** - expiratory noise (mainly)
- **Stridor** - inspiratory noise
- **Pleuritic Rub** - sounds like walking on snow
- **Bronchial Breathing** - sounds like wind moving through a tube, louder during expiration
