**Consent** - "Is that okay?"

**Questions** – "Do you have any questions before we start?"

## Presenting complaint

**Open question** – "I understand that you have had some 'presenting symptom on vignette' can you tell me all about that?"

**Allow the patient to talk** – it is important not to interrupt the patient at the start, unless they are going off topic.

## History of presenting complaint
