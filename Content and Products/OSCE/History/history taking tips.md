# History taking tips

Open question – I understand that you have had some [presenting symptom on vignette] 

Empathy

Cues – verbal, body language.

Rapport

Over talkative patients

Timing

Practice

Too much detail

Order

Echo - “I’ve got chest pain” “chest pain?...”

Active listening

Normalising – this is a question we ask everyone… some people with these symptoms experience… have you experienced this?

Don’t ask multiple questions in one go.

Pauses can be good, they can give the patient time to talk.
