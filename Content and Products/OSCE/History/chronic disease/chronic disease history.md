# Chronic disease history

You do not need to ask these questions for every patient, but if it is relevant to your presenting complaint you may want to ask a more detailed past medical history about the relevant condition.

For example, if a patient is presenting symptoms of a flare up of their crohn’s disease, you might want to ask more questions about their crohn’s disease.

## Past medical history

**Diagnosis** – When and how was it diagnosed?

**Management** – Current and previous management.

**Control** – How well controlled is the disease? How many admissions per year?

**Complications** – Any complications of the disease?
