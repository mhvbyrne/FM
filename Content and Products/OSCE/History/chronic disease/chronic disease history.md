#Chronic disease history

You do not need to ask these questions for every patient, but if it is relevant to your presenting complaint you may want to ask a more detailed past medical history about the relevant condition.

For example, if a patient is presenting symptoms of a flare up of their crohn’s disease, you might want to ask more questions about their crohn’s disease.

##Past medical history

**Diagnosis** – when and how was it diagnosed.

**Management** – current and previous management.

**Control** – how well controlled is the disease, how many admissions per year.

**Complications** – any complications of the disease?
