# History taking

## Introduction

Getting the best marks when taking histories is not about asking *all* of the questions, it is about asking a **concise** and **fluent** history that highlights important information and does not miss key sections.

We aim to help you get the best mark you can as painlessly as possible by presenting our concise histories. These include all the questions you *must* ask and explain the main areas that individuals make mistakes.

This will allow you to revise quickly, improve your fluency, and get the best mark you can.

We will present our reasoning for asking the questions we do and why we ask things in certain ways. However, if you find a way that works better for you, use it! And please let us know so that we can share this with the everyone else.

We will start with an overiew of history taking in general and this is followed by detailed histories for each system and specialty. For each cardinal symptom we will provided a cascade of additional questions that you need to ask to inform your differential. We will present a summary of the differentials for the main presenting symptoms you will come across. Finally, we present a series of mock cases and mark schemes for you to practice with your colleagues. To further increase the efficiency of your learning we present each section with a “need to know” score, to help you prioritise the order of your learning.

In doing so, you can choose the perfect level of focus for the stage you are at.

## Ojectives

Our objectives for this section are, to provide you with a:
- Comprehensive overview of history taking in general.
- Detailed explanations of histories for each system.
- A cascade of additional questions for each cardinal symptom.
- Differentials for the main presenting symptoms.
- Mock cases for you to practice.
- Mark schemes for each system history.

# History overview

A history consist of an introduction, presenting complaint (PC), history of presenting complaint (HPC), ideas, concerns and expectations (ICE), summarising, signposting, cardinal symptoms, risk factors and red flags (when appropriate), systemic enquiry, past medical history (PMH) and past surgical history (when appropriate), allergies, drug history (DH), family history (FH), and social history (SH).

For your exam you should be well presented and dressed in smart clothing. You should bring a watch with a stop watch function so that you can keep track of time.

## Introduction

**Wash hands** - even in a history station it is good to get into the habit of washing your hands whenever you see a patient.

**Introduction** – name, grade - "Hi I’m ..., I’m a final year medical student"

**Patient details** – name, date of birth, age - "Can I check your name, age, and date of birth please?"

**Explanation** – "I would like to ask you some questions about your symptoms"

**Consent** - "Is that okay?"

**Questions** – "Do you have any questions before we start?"

## Presenting complaint

**Open question** – "I understand that you have had some (presenting symptom on vignette) can you tell me all about that?"

**Allow the patient to talk** – it is important not to interrupt the patient at the start, unless they are going off topic.

### Why start with open questions?

**Open questions** are questions that cannot be answered with a *yes* or *no*, they allow the patient to describe their symptoms in their own words. It allows you to develop a broad understanding of the problem, before moving to **closed questions**, which are questions that can be answered with a *yes* or *no*. Because open questions are open-ended there is a risk that the patient can talk too much, which can waste time, and we will touch on how to avoid this in our tips section.

## History of presenting complaint

**SOCRATES** is a mnemonic that was designed to ask about **pain**, however, you can use it as a structure for most presenting complaints by omitting non relevant sections. Taking this approach means you do not need to remember a separate series of questions to enquire about the history of presenting complaint for each history.

- **S**ite – "Where is the (presenting symptom)?"
- **O**nset
  - "When did the symptoms start?"
  - Sudden or gradual?
  - Precipitating facotrs - "What were you doing when it started?"
- **C**haracter – "How would you describe the (symptom)?"
- **R**adiation – "Does the (symptom) go anywhere else?"
- **A**ssociated symptoms – "Did you have any other symptoms with the (presenting symptom)?"
- **T**imings
  - Frequency – "Ever had this before? How many times?"
  - Constant or intermittent?
  - Progression – "Is the (symptom) getting better or worse?"
  - Pattern – "Is it better of worse at any time of day? Year? Night time?"
  - Duration – "How long does it last?"
  - Termination – "What caused the symptoms to stop?"
- **E**xacerbating/relieving symptoms – "Does anything make the (symptom) better or worse?"
- **S**everity – "How bad are the symptoms? What impact has this had on your life?"

## Ideas, concerns, and expectations

**Ideas** – "Is there anything you think could be causing your symptoms?"

**Concerns** – "Is there anything you’re worried about?" – if there is, probe. "I can understand why that might be worrying, is there anything in particular about it that you are worried about?"

**Expectations** – "Is there anything else that you hope I will be able to help you with today?"

### Why ask ideas, concerns, and expectations?

Mark schemes often have specific marks for asking about a patient’s ideas, concerns, and expectations. They are also a good insight into areas which you may have accidentally overlooked.

For example, patients may mention they are worried about cancer, because one of their relatives had it, or that their symptoms are a side effect of a drug which they are taking (which might not be listed in their usual drugs list).

### Why ask ideas, concerns, and expectations here?

Students often worry that asking ideas, concerns, and expectations can sound awkward and unnatural. We have including these questions after the history of presenting complaint and with the phrasing above is the most natural way to ask. Asking these questions here also means it can inform the rest of the questions you ask, whereas, leaving them until the end of the history often seems awkward and you might forget to ask it completely.

## Summarise and signpost

**Summarise** – "Okay I just want to check that I have got everything correct. Your (presenting symptom) started…"

**Signpost** – "I’m now going to ask you some further questions about some symptoms you may have had."

### Why summarise and signpost?

**Summarising** allows you to check with the patient that the history you have taken is correct, it allows them to interject if they feel you have missed something.

**Signposting** is when you explain what you are going to ask the patient about next and it helps give the history structure.

Mark schemes have marks for both summarising and signposting, and you only need to do it once to get marks in this section, so if you summarise more than once you will waste time.

### Why summarise and signpost here?

Summarising and signposting here demonstrates to the examiner that you are switching from open questions to closed questions.

## Cardinal symptoms, risk factors, red flags, and systems enquiry

**Cardinal symptoms** – are the main symptoms for each system. They need to be asked for each history.

**Risk factors** – are characteristics which increase the probability of disease. It is not necessary to include risk factors for certain system histories.

**Red flags** – are symptoms which indicate there may be serious underlying pathology. It is not necessary to include red flags for certain system histories.

**Systems enquiry** – ask about symptoms separate to the main organ system which the history focuses on. For example, asking about weight loss in lung cancer. You can ask general constitutional symptoms and presentation specific symptoms.
- **General**
  - Fever
  - Weight loss
- **Presentation specific**
  - Presentation specific systems enquiry, this will be covered in the exploded symptoms section for each symptom

### Why have a focused systems enquiry?

Instead of asking a systems enquiry which encompasses all organ systems, you should focus on asking questions which rule in or out differential diagnoses. This is so that you do not waste time asking irrelevant questions.

For example, if a patient presents with chest pain, as well as focusing on the cardiovascular system you may also want to include some respiratory and gastrointestinal cardinal symptoms to rule out conditions such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or gastroesophageal reflux disease.

You can use the mnemonic MUNCHEBARS to help remember each of the organ systems, if you are stuck. But you need to be wary when conducting your systems enquiry as you can waste time by asking too many irrelevant questions here.

- **M**usculoskeletal
- **U**rinary
- **N**eurological
- **C**ardiovascular
- **H**epatic
- **E**ndocrine
- **B**lood
- **A**limentary
- **R**espiratory
- **S**kin

## Past medical history

**Open question** – "Do you have any other medical conditions?"

**Relevant to presenting complaint** – You may also want to ask specific questions relevant to the presenting complaint or system. 
- Specific operations
- Specific diseases

### Past medical history closed questions

Be wary about asking too many closed questions here, as many of the questions will be irrelevant and will waste time. Instead you may want to ask specific questions relevant to the presenting complaint or system. For example, if a patient presents with lethargy you may want to ask if they have a history of any thyroid problems or anaemia.

Similarly, we do not recommend mnemonics here as they are often too broad and can waste valuable time, but if you do wish to use a mnemonic use **MJ THREADS Ca**.

- **M**yocardial infarction
- **J**aundice
- **T**hyroid
- **H**ypertension
- **R**heumatic fever/any childhood illness
- **E**pilepsy
- **A**ngina
- **D**iabetes
- **S**troke
- **Ca**ncer.

## Allergies

**Drug allergies** – Make sure to ask about allergies, some people fail because they forget to ask. If there is an allergy probe.
- Type of allergy – What happened? Is it a true allergy (i.e. anaphylaxis or rash)?

## Drug history

Patient’s are often on very long lists of medications, so be wary of this section as it can waste valuable time. You may prefer to leave it until the end, particularly if you are not given a list of medications on the vignette.

**Drugs list** - "Do you have a list of your medications?"

**Specific drugs** – You do not need to ask this for everyone, only if relevant to the presenting complaint. For example, anticoagulants if a patient presents with bleeding.

**Changes to drugs** – New or stopped

**Over the counter** – Homeopathic/herbal

**Recreational drugs** – Make sure to normalise - "This is a question we ask everyone, do you take any recreational drugs?"

## Family history

You can chose to ask a specific question and/or a general question.

- **Specific** - "Has anyone else in your family had a similar problem?"
- **General** - "Do any illnesses run in the family?"

For most situations you only need to be concerned about diseases in 1st degree relatives.

## Social history

**Occupation history** – "Do you have a job?" *OR* "Have you had a job in the past?"

**Smoking history** – "Have you ever smoked? Do you still smoke? How many a day? How many years?"

It’s best to ask have you ever smoked? Rather than “Do you smoke” because then you establish immediately if they are a non-smoker and do not have to ask a second question.
- 20 cigarettes per day for one year = 1 pack year

**Alcohol history** – "Do you drink alcohol? How many units do you drink per week?"

**Home** – "Is there anyone else at home?" You do not need to ask this question to everyone, often it is only important if the person is a child, elderly, or has a disease which may limit their day to day activities.

**Activities of daily living** – "Do you have any problems with washing? Dressing? Or cooking yourself?" If there are any problems identified you can also ask if the patient has any carers. You do not need to ask this question to everyone, often it is only important if the person is a child, elderly, or has a disease which may limit their day to day activities.

## Closing

Is there anything else you think I ought to know?

Thank you, do you have any questions?

## Summary

**Summary** – This is a [age] year old [race] [sex] [job] who presented with worsening/improving [presenting symptom] for [duration], associated with [cardinal symptoms], on a background of [relevant past medical history, family history, social history, drug history].

### How to have a fluent summary

Summarising is a difficult skill. When inexperienced students are asked to summarise they recite their entire history from start to finish, failing to realise that the examiner has sat through your history and has heard it all. Instead the examiner wants a very concise overview of your history.

A summary of a history and examination should be no longer than a minute, and the summary should be weighted more towards your examination findings because the examiner cannot see, feel, or hear what you do so you *need* to convey this information. As such, the summary should be limited to one or two sentences in the style of the above example.

To help with your fluency, you can write out the above sentence before you take your history and leave blank sections for you to fill in while you are taking your history. That what when you are asked to summarise you already have a summary written down.

## Differential

**Most likely diagnosis** – My top differential is…

**Differential** – My other differentials are…

**Less likely important conditions not to miss** – I would also like to rule out...

For example, this is a 47 year old asian female factory worker who presented with a one week history of worsening cough, associated with green phlegm, shortness of breath, and fever; on a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and a 20 pack year history of smoking. My top differential is an infective exacerbation of COPD, my other differentials are a community acquired pneumonia and tuberculosis. I would also like to rule out pneumoconiosis and lung cancer.
