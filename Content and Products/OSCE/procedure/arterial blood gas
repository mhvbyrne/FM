# Arterial Blood Gas

## Overview

Arterial Blood Gas sampling is a common procedure used to obtain arterial blood, which can be used to measure oxygenation, carbon dioxide level, and acid-base balance. It can also be used to measure electrolytes, haemoglobin, and lactate quickly.

## Equipment
- Gloves
- Apron
- Disinfectant wipes - 2% chlorhexidine, 70% alcohol
- Arterial blood gas syringe and needle - most blood gas syringes have a needle attached, otherwise use a 23G needle.
- Cotton wool or gauze
- Tape
- Sharps bin
- Local anaesthetic equipment - not always required, unlikely to be required in exams

## Introduction

**Wash hands**

**Introduction** - Name, grade

**Patient details** - Name, date of birth, age

**Explanation** - “I’d like to take a blood test from your wrist to measure the level of oxygen in your blood. It may be more painful than an ordinary blood test and there’s a risk of bruising and bleeding, infection, and damage to the artery”

**Consent** - “Is that okay?”

**Positioning** - palm up, wrist extended at 20-30 degrees, resting on a pillow

**Exposure** - bare below elbow, remove watch

**Question** - "Before we start do you have any pain or questions?"

## Preparation
- **Oxygen?** - record the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) or flow rate.
- **Contraindications?** - these are rarely encountered and may be relative depending on the urgency of the sample. If you have any concerns about whether to take a sample ask your senior.
    - Absent ulnar collateral
    - Peripheral vascular disease
    - Local infection
    - Arteriovenous fistula
    - Coagulopathy
- **Prepare equipment** - using aseptic non-touch technique
- **Perform Allan’s test**
- Local anaesthetic

### Allan’s test

Ask the examiner if they would like you to perform Allan’s Test.

**Allan’s test** aims to assess the **patency of the ulnar artery**.
- Ask the patient to make a fist
- Occlude both the radial artery and ulnar artery with your fingers
- Ask the patient to open their hand - the palm should look pale
- Release your fingers over the ulnar artery
- Ulnar artery patency is demonstrated by a **change in hand colour from pale to normal**
- If the ulnar artery is patent you may procede with the procedure.

### Local anaesthetic

Ask the examiner if they would like you to administer local anaesthetic.

The British Thoracic Society recommends that local anaesthetic should be used, unless it is an emergency or in an unconscious patient.
- Administer local anaesthetic if required, prior to taking the arterial blood sample.

## Procedure
- Palpate the radial artery
- Feel for point of maximal pulse
- Clean area with disinfectant wipes - for 30 seconds, allow to dry
- Wash hands
- Don gloves and apron
- Repalpate pulse - but **do not** repalpate the area where you will insert needle
- Expel heparin from syringe and withdraw plunger back ~1.5cm
- Warn patient - “sharp scratch”
- Insert needle slowly
  - Hold in dominant hand like a pen
  - 45 degrees to skin
  - Up to one centimetre in front of the finger which is palpating the pulse.
- Look for flashback
- Wait for syringe to fill itself
- Obtain 1 to 2 millilitres of blood - confirm with laboratory exact amount required
- Withdraw needle
- Activate needle safety guard mechanism
- Apply cotton wool or gauze with tape
- Instruct patient to press down hard for at least one minute
  - If the patient is unconscious you or a colleague should do this to prevent haematoma formation
  - They may need to press for longer if they are on anticoagulants
- Dispose of needle in sharps bin
- Expel any air
- Place cap on syringe
- Label sample

## Closing

Thank you, do you have any questions?

- Dispose of equipment
- Wash hands
- Analyse arterial blood gas sample
  - Analysis needs to be prompt to ensure accuracy
  - If it is in an emergency situation you or a colleague should act as the *runner*, the person who takes the sample to the blood gas machine for analysis
  - If there is a delay in sampling the accuracy of the sample may be affected and the sample may clot
  - If there is a delay in sampling you can place the sample on ice
- Document results
  - Handwrite key results, don’t just tape it in the notes
  - Including FiO2 or oxygen flow rate
- Make a plan
- If you have failed to obtain a sample or require help acting on the results, escalate to your senior

## Tips

### Unable to obtain flashback

If you are unable to obtain flashback you can try the following tricks:
- Advance the needle further, in some patient’s you may have to advance quite deep, particularly in obese patients
- Slowly withdraw the needle but do not leave the skin
- Repalpate, reangle and advance
- Repeat the above steps two times and if unsuccessful withdraw completely
- Repalpate and retry
  - You may find that you only need to go 1 to 2 millimeters left or right of your original insertion sige to be successful.

### I have flashback but my syringe will not fill

1. You may have gone to quickly! It is likely that you have gone through the artery wall or you have just knicked the side wall of the artery. To fix this:
  - Withdraw the needle slowly. It may fill on its own.
  - Repalpate, reangle and advance
  - Restart procedure

1. Alternatively, while the syringe should fill itself, in some patients you may find that this does not happen. To fix this:
  - While it is not best practice, you may need to pull back on the plunger to aspirate enough blood and this is why not to pull the syringe plunger back too far.
  - You should not have this problem during exams as the examiner will be pumping the blood forcefully through an artificial arm.

### Weak or absent pulse

If you are only able to feel a weak pulse at one wrist try the other wrist. If you cannot obtain a sample from the wrist you can palpate for the brachial artery and then the femoral artery using a femoral stab.

But there are some disadvantages to using these arteries:
- More difficult to locate
- Reduced collateral circulation
- Important nearby structures which may be damaged

### Allan’s test

Specificity Sensititivy

### Venous sample instead of arterial

If the oxygen level is much lower than expected you may have obtained a venous or mixed arterial and venous sample instead of pure arterial blood. How to fix this:
- You can check the oxygen saturation of the sample and compare it to the oxygen saturation a the finger
- If there is a large discrepancy and an arterial sample is required you will need to retake the sample

### Identify the nearest blood gas machine

Prior to performing arterial blood gas sampling you should ask where the nearest blood gas machine is, and if you have time ensure that it is working prior to sampling.
