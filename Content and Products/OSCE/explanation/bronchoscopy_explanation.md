## Explanation

### Description

**Bronchoscopy** - "is a camera test to look into a your lungs because of [reason], which projects onto a screen that the doctor can see." 

Reasons:
- Chronic cough
- Haemoptysis
- Abnormal findings on Chest X ray or CT scan.

  - Infection
  - Tumours
  - Mucus
  - Bleeding
- **Investigation** - "If there are any abnormalities a sample of tissue can be taken called a biopsy or washing out cells with salt water."
  - Biopsy
  - Bronchial lavage
- **Treatment** - "It can also be used to treat certain lung problems."
  - Remove inhaled foreign body
  - Stent collapsed airway
  - Remove tumour if blocking airway

### Details

#### Before

- **Oral intake** - no food for 4 hours, clear fluids until 2 hours before
- **Clotting test**
- **Aspirin or warfarin** may be stopped - discuss with doctor
- **Cannula**

#### During

The procedure takes around 30 minutes and involves:
- **Sedation** - "Which will make you feel more relaxed and it may mean you can't remember the procedure."
- **Lignocaine gel** - "So that you don't feel the camera."
- **Camera** - "Camera goes in through the nose and down your windpipe and can inspect your lungs from the inside."
  - Flexible - thin tube flexible
  - Rigid - requires general anaesthetic, used for children and some procedures
- **Biopsy** - "Using the tube that the camera is in, we can also take tissue samples." 
- **Bronchial lavage** - "We can also spray salt water into the lung to collect cells.

#### After
