**Detailed chronic condition history** – you do not need to ask this for every patient, but if it is relevant to your presenting complaint you may want to ask a more detailed past medical history about the relevant condition. For example, if a patient is presenting symptoms of a flare up of their crohn’s disease, you might want to ask more questions about their crohn’s disease.
Diagnosis – when and how was it diagnosed.
Management – current and previous management.
Control – how well controlled is the disease, how many admissions per year.
Complications – any complications of the disease?
