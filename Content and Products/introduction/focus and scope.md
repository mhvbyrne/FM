# Focus and Scope

In this section we present the **Aim, Philosophy, and Objectives** of **focus**|medicine.

## Aims

The aim of **focus**medicine is to create a *concise* set of revision materials which are targeted at *high yield* areas. In doing so we have optimized the revision process so that it is as *painless* and *efficient* as possible.

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is that you don’t need to be the best to **become the best**.

Getting the best marks in exams is not about knowing everything in your textbooks and recommended reading, or learning everything discussed in ward rounds and lectures, it is about *focused learning for exams*.

This may sound obvious, but a lot of individuals approach exams with the concept of “if I make notes on everything in these books I will do well in my exam”. While this approach may work for some, it is incredibly inefficient, requires a huge amount of effort, and commonly leads to burnout. Which leads to disappointing results for most people.

This what I found during my first clinical exams where I spent too long trying to make a comprehensive set of notes thinking if I learnt everything I would do well in exams, but I was disappointed. Why? Because my approach was not *focused* and I was overwhelmed. In my final exams, I changed my learning style to focus on *core knowledge* and *techniques*, and because of this I achieved a top 10% result in finals.

## Objectives

Our objectives are to:

- Present *the* set of core knowledge you need
- Collate this set from a wide range of sources and ask experts to review it
- To create notes you can *trust*
- To prevent you wasting time writing your own notes
- Grading each topic with a **Need to Know** score so you can prioritise the order in which learn information.

- Demonstrate the *techniques* you can use
- To *structure* answers
- To improve *fluency*

- Develop your learning to help you **become the best**
