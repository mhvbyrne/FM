## Need to Know Score

Our **Need to Know** score aims to increase the efficiency of your learning.

One problem I encountered when I was learning new material was: “do I really need to learn this?”. Without experience I spent too long learning about areas that were not *high yield*, meaning they were less likely to come up in exams, at the expense of material that did come up in exams.

Our **Need to Know** score helps you to prioritise which information to learn first.

For example, the cardiovascular examination has a score of 5, because it is almost guaranteed to come up in your exam, whereas an elbow examination has a score of 1, because it will very rarely come up but you still need to know it because it is on the syllabus. This way you know which are the most important topics to revise so you know them inside out, and do not sacrifice this by prioritising topics which are less relevant to the exam.
