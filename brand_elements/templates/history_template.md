# ... History

## Overview

The ... history is (...a very common/a common/an uncommon (if uncommon state why we need to cover it)) station during clinical examinations. Here we demonstrate our concise ... history that will help you pick up on key information during your exam.

## Introduction

**Wash hands**

**Introduction** – name, grade

**Patient details** – name, date of birth, age

**Explanation** – "I would like to ask you some questions about your symptoms"

**Consent** - "Is that okay?"

**Questions** – "Do you have any questions before we start?"

## Presenting complaint

**Open question** – "I understand that you have had some 'presenting symptom on vignette' can you tell me all about that?"

**Allow the patient to talk** – it is important not to interrupt the patient at the start, unless they are going off topic.

## History of presenting complaint

(...delete as appropriate)

- **Site** – "Where is the 'presenting symptom'?"
- **Onset**
  - "When did the symptoms start?"
  - Sudden or gradual?
  - Precipitating facotrs - "What were you doing when it started?"
- **Character** – "How would you describe the 'presenting symptom'?"
- **Radiation** – "Does the 'presenting symptom' go anywhere else?"
- **Associated symptoms** – "Did you have any other symptoms with the 'presenting symptom'?"
- **Timings**
  - Frequency – "Ever had this before? How many times?"
  - Constant or intermittent?
  - Progression – "Is the 'presenting symptom' getting better or worse?"
  - Pattern – "Is it better of worse at any time of day? Year? Night time?"
  - Duration – "How long does it last?"
  - Termination – "What caused the symptoms to stop?"
- **Exacerbating/relieving symptoms** – "Does anything make the 'presenting symptom' better or worse?"
- **Severity** – "How bad are the symptoms? What impact has this had on your life?"

## Ideas, concerns, and expectations

**Ideas** – "Is there anything you think could be causing your symptoms?"

**Concerns** – "Is there anything you’re worried about?" – if there is, probe. "I can understand why that might be worrying, is there anything in particular about it that you are worried about?"

**Expectations** – "Is there anything else that you hope I will be able to help you with today?"

## Summarise and signpost

**Summarise** – "Okay I just want to check that I have got everything correct. Your (presenting symptom) started…"

**Signpost** – "I’m now going to ask you some further questions about some symptoms you may have had."

## Risk factors
(...Not necessary for some system histories. Delete if not appropriate)

## Red flags
(...Not necessary for some system histories. Delete if not appropriate)

## Systems enquiry

**General**
- Fever
- Weight loss

**Presentation specific**
- Presentation specific systems enquiry, this will be covered in the exploded symptoms section for each symptom

## Past medical history

**Open question** – "Do you have any other medical conditions?"

**Specific operations** to be aware of: (... use our surgical seive)

**Specific diseases** to be aware of: (... use our surgical seive)

**Presentation specific** - if a disease is of particular importance to a presentation you may want to ask specifically about that disease, but do not ask a big list otherwise you will waste time.

## Allergies

**Drug allergies** - If there is an allergy probe.
- Type of allergy – What happened? Is it a true allergy, i.e. anaphylaxis or rash?

## Drug history

**Drugs list** - "Do you have a list of your medications?"

**Specific drugs** to be aware of: ...

Changes to drugs – New or stopped

Over the counter – Homeopathic/herbal

Recreational drugs – Make sure to normalise - "This is a question we ask everyone, do you take any recreational drugs?"

## Family history

You can chose to ask a specific question and/or a general question.

**General** - "Do any illnesses run in the family?"

**Specific** - "Has anyone else in your family had a similar problem?" - Specific diseases to be aware of: ...

For most situations you only need to be concerned about diseases in 1st degree relatives.

## Social history

**Occupation history** – "Do you have a job?" *OR* "Have you had a job in the past?"

**Smoking history** – "Have you ever smoked? Do you still smoke? How many a day? How many years?"

**Alcohol history** – "Do you drink alcohol? How many units do you drink per week?"

**Home** – "Is there anyone else at home?" You do not need to ask this question to everyone, often it is only important if the person is a child, elderly, or has a disease which may limit their day to day activities.

**Activities of daily living** – "Do you have any problems with washing? Dressing? Or cooking yourself?" If there are any problems identified you can also ask if the patient has any carers. You do not need to ask this question to everyone, often it is only important if the person is a child, elderly, or has a disease which may limit their day to day activities.

## Closing

Thank you, do you have any questions?
