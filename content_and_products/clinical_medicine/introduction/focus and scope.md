# Focus and Scope

## Aims

The aim of **focus**|medicine is to create a **concise** set of revision materials which are targeted at **high yield** areas. In doing so we have optimized the revision process so that it is as **painless** and **efficient** as possible.

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is that you don’t need to be the best to ***become the best***.

Getting the best marks in exams is not about knowing everything in your textbooks and recommended reading, or learning everything discussed in ward rounds and lectures, it is about **focused learning for exams**.

This may sound obvious, but a lot of individuals approach exams with the concept of “if I make notes on everything in these books I will do well in my exam”. While this approach may work for some, it is incredibly inefficient, requires a huge amount of effort, and commonly leads to burnout. Which leads to disappointing results for most people.

This what I found during my first clinical exams where I spent too long trying to make a comprehensive set of notes thinking if I learnt everything I would do well in exams, but I was disappointed. Why? Because my approach was not *focused* and I was overwhelmed. In my final exams, I changed my learning style to focus on **core knowledge** and **techniques**, and because of this I achieved a top 10% result in finals.

## Objectives

Our objectives are to:

- Present *the* set of core knowledge you need.
  - Collate this set from a wide range of sources and ask experts to review it.
  - To create notes you can *trust*.
  - To prevent you wasting time writing your own notes.
  - Grading each topic with a **Need to Know** score so you can prioritise the order in which learn information.

- Demonstrate the **techniques** you can use.
  - To **structure** answers.
  - To improve **fluency**.

- Develop your learning to help you **become the best**.

## Why chose focus|medicine?

The problem with other resources is:
- Low quality
  - No focus - too much text
  - No structure - due to poor editing
- Not written from many sources
  - Which means students feel as though they need to read all the other materials on the same topic for their *perfect* set of notes
- No review
  - From students
  - From seniors
- No way to differentiate must know topics
- Minimal collaboration
