# Respiratory Examination

## Objectives

The respiratory examination is very common station during clinical examinations. Here we demonstrate our concise Respiratory Examination that will help you pick up on key clinical signs during your exam.

## Introduction

**Wash hands**

**Introduction** - Name, position

**Check patient details** - Name, date of birth, age

**Explanation** - "I would like to perform an examination of your chest which will involve looking at your hands, face, and chest, placing my hands on your chest, and listening with a stethoscope."

**Consent** - Is that okay?

**Positioning** - 45 degrees

**Exposure** - Whole chest to hips - "So that I can properly see your chest can you remove your top please?" In exams, it is not necessary to ask females to remove their bra.

**Question** - "Before we start do you have any pain or questions?"

## General Inspection

### Around bed
- Oxygen - COPD, interstilial lung disease
- Inhalers/nebulisers - COPD, asthma
- Sputum pot - note colour of sputum
- Peak flow meters - asthma
- Medications - steroids, antibiotics - COPD, asthma

### Patient
- Age
  - Young - asthma, cystic fibrosis
  - Old - pneumonia, cancer, COPD, interstitial lung disease
- Cyanosed - oxygen saturation <85%
- Pallor - anaemia of chronic disease
- Cachexic - chronic disease - cancer, COPD, cystic fibrosis
- Cushingoid - steroids - asthma, COPD
- Added sounds - cough, wheeze, hoarseness, stridor, stertor, agonal
  - Stertor - snoring sounds caused by partial upper airway obstruction
  - Agonal - laboured gasping, emergency sign - extreme hypoxia
- Unwell or in pain? Signs of respiratory disress? - acute/acute on chronic problem

## Extremities

### Nails
- Clubbing - lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis
- Peripheral cyanosis - oxygen saturations <85%
- Tar staining - smoker - increased risk of COPD and lung cancer.

### Hands

#### Inspection
- Wasting - lung cancer
- Pallor - anaemia
- Thinning, bruised skin - steroids - used in exacerbations of COPD and asthma, and interstitial lung disease
- Rheumatoid arthritis - associated with pleural effusion, pulmonary fibrosis
- Palmar erythema
- Fine tremor - bronchodilator use
- Coarse tremor - carbon dioxide retention flap - COPD

#### Palpation
- Temperature
- Capillary refill time

### Wrist

#### Inspection
- Respiratory rate - normal between 12-20 breaths/minute

#### Palpation
- Pulse - rate, rhythm - over 15 second period and multiply by four. Make sure to remember this for your summary!
  - Bounding - CO2 retention
  - Paradoxical - you can auscultate a heartbeat but cannot palpate the beat at the wrist - respiratory distress
- Painful swelling of wrists - may indicate squamous cell carcinoma of lung (HPOA)

### Arm
- Blood pressure

## Face

### Eyes
- Conjunctival pallor - ask patient to pull down lower eyelid - anaemia
- Swollen eyes - superior vena cava obstruction
- Horner’s sign - ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis, enopthalmus - pancoast tumour

### Face
- Malar Flush
- Cushingoid

### Mouth
- Cyanosis - central (under tongue)
- Candida - steroids

### Neck

#### Inspection
- JVP - cor pulmonale

#### Palpation
Warn patient that you are going to touch their "wind pipe" and it may be uncomfortable.
- Tracheal tug - three fingers on trachea ///
- Tracheal deviation - to right or left
- Cricosternal distance - normally >3 fingers, <3 demonstrates hyperexpansion
- Lymph nodes - lung cancer, tuberculosis.
  - Palpate from behind the patient, with the patient sat forwards
  - Lymph nodes to palpate - submental (below chin), submandibular (under jaw), pre- and post- auricular (infront and behind ear), occipital, anterior and posterior cervical (front and back of sternocleidomastoid), supraclavicular. 

## Chest

### Front of chest

#### Inspection

Ask patient to lift arms, to look at sides as well

- Scars
  - Mid axilla, small - chest drain
  - Horizontal posterolateral - thoracotomy for pneumonectomy, lobectomy
- Chest wall deformity - barrel chest in COPD, excavatum, carinatum, kyphoscholiosis
- Asymmetry - surgery e.g. pneumonectomy - cancer, thoracoplasty - tuberculosis

#### Palpation
- Chest wall expansion - only need to do once
- Apex beat - displaced in scoliosis, dilatation of the left ventricle
  - midclavicular line, 5th intercostal space. Make sure that you demonstrate to the examiner by palpating down the intercostal spaces from the manubriosternal joint (2nd intercostal space)
- Right heave - Right ventricle hypertrophy due to pulmonary hypertension

#### Percussion
- Clavicles - percuss directly without placing finger on top of clavicle
- Two other areas
- Axillae
Compare left to right side

Note quality of sound
- Resonant - normal
- Hyper-resonant - air
- Dull - fluid

#### Auscultation and vocal resonance
- Apices - listen with bell just behind clavicle
- Two other areas - listen with diaphragm
- Axillae
Compare left to right side

### Back

#### Inspection
- Scars - pneumonectomy, lobectomy
- Deformity - kyphoscoliosis, ankylosing spondylitis

#### Palpation, percussion, ausculation
Ask the patient to cross their arms to move the scapulae out of the way.
- Expansion
- Sacral oedema
- Percuss and auscultate in three areas, comparing left to right side

## Legs
- Rash - erythema nodosum
- Pedal oedema - cor pulmonale, right sided heart failure

## Finish

Thank patient and ask if they have any questions

## Extra tests

To finish I would also like to perform the following:
- **Examination** - Cardiovascular if indicated, axillary lymph nodes if cancer, liver edge if COPD
- **Bedside** - Oxygen saturations, blood pressure, temperature, peak expiratory flow rate.
- **Bloods** - Arterial blood gas (if low saturations)
- **Imaging** - Chest X ray
- **Special tests** - Spirometry (if COPD)
- **Microbiology** - Sputum culture

## Summary

If you are completing your examination as part of a separate examination station in your exam you can use the following summary structure. If you are completing it alongside a history you should start with your history summary before moving on to your examination summary and omit the demographic information at the start.

This is a 'age' 'sex', on inspection there was... on palpation there was... on percussion there was... on auscultation there was...

## Differential

**Most likely diagnosis** – "My top differential is…"

**Differential** – "My other differentials are…"

**Less likely important conditions not to miss** – "I would also like to rule out..."

## Technique

### Sputum type
  - White, viscous - asthma
  - Grey, clear - COPD
  - Yellow or green colour - infective causes
  - Red colour - Pneumococcal pneumonia
  - Blood stained - infective causes, cancer, pulmonary embolism
  - Frothy, pink - heart failure
  - Large volume - bronchiectasis

### Respiratory rate
  - Complete while taking pulse, do not mention to the patient that you are checking their respiratory rate otherwise they will become concious of their breathing and you will not obtain an accurate rate.
  - Look at the patient's sternum and count breaths taken over a 15 second period.
  - Multiply by four to obtain the total number over one minute. Make sure to remember this for your summary!
  
### JVP
  - 45 degrees
  - Turn head to left
  - Look at sternocleidomastoid
  - Measure number of centimeters above sternal notch

### Chest wall expansion

Ask patient to take a deep breath in and out, place hands on chest wrapping hands around the base of chest and oppose your thumbs, then ask patient to breath in again to see how the tips of your thumbs move to assess expansion and symmetry.

### Tactile and vocal resonance

Ask the patient to repeat 99 each time you place your hand (tactile resonance) or your stethoscope (vocal resonance) on the chest. Resonance is increased in areas of consolidation. Some universities do not require you to complete tactile or vocal resonance, you should check with your education team if it is expected for you to ask.

### Added sounds on auscultation
- **Crepitations** - sounds like crackles, and can be fine or coarse
  - If crepitations elicited ask the patient to cough - do they clear?
- **Wheeze** - expiratory noise (mainly)
- **Stridor** - inspiratory noise
- **Pleuritic Rub** - sounds like walking on snow
- **Bronchial Breathing** - hollow sounds like wind moving through a tube, louder during expiration - consolidation, fibrosis

Some more information about added sounds can be found here: https://www.medicaleducationleeds.com/paces/respiratory-examination/ ///

### Signs of respiratory distress
Not speaking in full sentences, tachypnoea, tripod position, using accessory muscles, intercostal recession, pursed lips, nasal flaring, tracheal tug (thyroid cartilage being pulled to the sternal notch during inspiration), pulsus paradoxus, paradoxical respiration (diaphragm rises with inspiration).

### Breathing patterns
- Hyperventilation (RR>20)
  - Can lead to respiratory alkalosis, which can cause hypocalcaemia and perioral paraesthesia ± muscle spasms.
- Hypoventilation (RR<12) - opiate overdose
- Kussmaul breathing - deep sighing breathing, due to metabolic acidosis - DKA, renal failure.
- Cheyne-Stokes breathing - cycles of deep then shallow breathing with periods of apnoea - brainstem lesions or compression - stroke, raised ICP.
