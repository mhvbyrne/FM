They also run live events which have a separate fee.

---
#### Revenue

* 4500 members
* £5 per month fee
* £270,000 per annum

All the notes are free


**Uncertaincies**
* It is unclear how many of these may have recieved a discount
* This does not take into account the money earnt from live events

---
#### Pros
* Very pretty
* High quality images
* High quality illustrations
* Video explainer
* Mobile device app
* Content is only developed in house - quality
* Can download and print notes from website free of charge
* FAQ page explaining billing, and charges http://www.pulsenotes.com/faqs/
* Blog for updates about the website
* Sign up/billing page simple
* Discount code on billing page
* Nursing students, and Physician associate students also targetted
* Coming soon for new notes
* Exam button on top right of notes

### Cons
* Slow loading time
* Lag on scrolling on website
* Very small - only 95 topics covered.
* Small team - only 3 doctors, who write all content
* No review process
* Live events - only run by the 3 doctors who founded the platform, only in one location (London)
* Uploads one new topic per month (maximum)
* Content is only developed in house - reduced output, but they say this may change in the future
* Blog hasn't been updated in a year
* Just targeted at students
* Notes not tagged to see what is relevant for nursing students and physicians associates.
* Poor quality tables, unable to see the text
* No pre-clinical medicine
* Incomplete set of areas, vague areas - diabetes and endocrinology as separate areas
* Specialty grouping doesn't make sense, why is oncology, haematology in the specialties category?
* Repetition in notes
* Anatomy section is weak - not as many diagrams as I would like, not enough information in diagrams, too wordy.
* Cases are just a breakdown of a presenting complaint

### Improvements
* Comphrensive coverage of topics
* Larger team
* Senior review process
* Live events - more people running the events, more locations
* Exam button - could have questions directly related to note topic just read, each page could have 5 questions associated with it (not just MCQs) and the person could answer these questions following reading the topic, rather than going and doing all the MCQ questions which aren't directly relevant.
* High yield summary, around 4 lines long for each topic at the start, before the definition. Similar to the hyperkalaemia example. Designed to be an answer to: tell me about hyperkalaemia... It should be the minimum you should know for each topic.
